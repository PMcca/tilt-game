# 2D Tilt Game Prototype

This is the prototype for a physics-based puzzle game created in Construct 2. The aim is to use the buttons at the bottom of the screen to
control the contraptions which guide the ball to the goal, a flag at the end of the level. Use the star pick-ups to boost the ball in the 
desired direction.
